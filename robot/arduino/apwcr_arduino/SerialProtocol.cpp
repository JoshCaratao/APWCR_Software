/*
  SerialProtocol.cpp

  Purpose:
  Implements the SerialProtocol class. This file contains the parsing logic and telemetry formatting
  for Arduino to communicate cleanly with the Python controller.

  Notes:
  - Parsing should be robust to partial reads.
  - Telemetry should be lightweight and sent at a fixed rate.
